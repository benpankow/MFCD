  * A telegram bot that sends facebook page posts directly to your telegram account!
  * Be able to keep up to date with your latest interests without having to get on the distraction that is social media!

 * Create your own bot and use this code or modify this code to do whatever you need
 * Use the official MFCD bot (coming soon!)

## Features
 * Image posts and gallery posts
 * Saves user subscriptions if bot stops running, and command or new posts made while offline will be processed when bot comes back online
 * Abstracted version of original MEMR, allowing support for many content platforms
 * Currently supports: Facebook feeds, Twitter feeds

## About
The original version of MCFD (titled memr) was developed in a few hours by Marshall Mueller and I in UW Madison's UPL in the spring of 2016, following which I decided to rework the system to accomidate a larger variety of content feeds.
